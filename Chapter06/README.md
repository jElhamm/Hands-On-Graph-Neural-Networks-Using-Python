# Chapter 6

   In this chapter, we dive deep into various graph-based operations using PyTorch Geometric.We explore important graph data processing techniques,
   visualization, and practical model implementations such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for both classification and regression tasks.

## Key Highlights

**1. Reproducibility with Random Seeds**

   - Ensuring consistent results by setting random seeds across different operations, crucial for machine learning experiments.

**2. Linear Algebra Operations**

   - Implementing matrix inversion and other key operations essential for understanding graph theory and its applications.

**3. Graph Visualization**

   - Visualizing the node degree distributions of popular datasets like Cora from the Planetoid dataset and the Facebook Page-Page dataset. Understanding how graph structures vary is key to model performance.

**4. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**

   - We implement and train a GCN for node classification using both the Cora and Facebook Page-Page datasets. This involves defining the GCN architecture, training it using CrossEntropyLoss, and evaluating the model's performance based on accuracy.

**5. Regression with GCNs**

   - Extending GCNs for regression tasks, we train a GCN on the Wikipedia Network dataset and use it to predict continuous values, evaluating the results using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**6. Data Loading and Plotting**

   - Utilities for loading real-world datasets like Wikipedia Network and plotting both degree distributions and target distributions to better understand the datasets before model training.

**7. Model Evaluation and Visualization**

   - We measure the GCN's performance for both classification and regression using metrics such as accuracy, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. Additionally, we visualize the predicted vs. ground truth values to assess model predictions effectively.
