## ‚≠êÔ∏è Book Description

   [Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) have quickly emerged as a cutting-edge technology in deep learning, only a decade after their inception. They are transforming industries worth billions, such as drug discovery, where they played a pivotal role in predicting a novel antibiotic named Halicin. Today, tech companies are exploring their applications in various fields, including recommender systems for food, videos, and romantic partners, as well as fake news detection, chip design, and 3D reconstruction.

   In this book, "Graph Neural Networks," we will delve into the core principles of graph theory and learn how to create custom datasets from raw or tabular data. We will explore key graph neural network architectures to grasp essential concepts like graph convolution and self-attention. This foundational knowledge will then be used to understand and implement specialized models tailored for specific tasks such as link prediction and graph classification, as well as various contexts including spatio-temporal data and heterogeneous graphs. Ultimately, we will apply these techniques to solve real-world problems and begin building a professional portfolio.
