# Chapter 7

   In Chapter 7 of the Hands-On Graph Neural Networks Using Python, we explore Graph Attention Networks (GAT), focusing on practical implementations using the Cora and CiteSeer datasets. This chapter walks you through setting up, training, and evaluating a GAT model, which uses attention mechanisms to improve node representation learning in graph data.

## Files

   The chapter provides two essential files:

   - [`chapter7.py`](Chapter07/chapter7.py): Contains the complete code for the GAT implementation in Python.

   - [`chapter7.ipynb`](Chapter07/chapter7.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook version of the same code for an interactive experience.

## Key Concepts

   1. SeedSetter Class:

      - Ensures reproducibility by setting random seeds for different components, such as PyTorch and NumPy.

   2. GraphOperations Class:

      - Implements the core operations for graph convolutions using attention mechanisms. The class contains utility methods for softmax and activation functions like Leaky ReLU.

   3. GAT Model:

      Defines a two-layer GAT model using torch_geometric. It consists of:

      - An input layer with multi-head attention.

      - A second layer for node classification.

      - Methods for training, validation, and accuracy calculations.

   4. DataVisualizer Class:

      Provides methods to visualize key metrics such as:

      - Node Degree Distribution: Displays the frequency of nodes by their degree.

      - Accuracy by Node Degree: Shows the performance of the GAT model relative to the degrees of nodes in the graph.

## Steps in the Code

   **1. Library Installation:** Installs necessary PyTorch Geometric libraries.

   **2. Cora Dataset Training:** The GAT model is trained on the Cora dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated.

   **3. CiteSeer Dataset Training:** A similar process is followed for the CiteSeer dataset, with additional visualizations of node degrees and accuracies.

   **4. Graph Convolution Example:** Demonstrates how attention-based graph convolutions are performed.

## Datasets

   The Cora and CiteSeer datasets are well-known citation network datasets:

   - *Cora*: Contains 2708 nodes and 5429 edges, where nodes represent papers and edges represent citation links.

   - *CiteSeer*: A slightly larger dataset with 3327 nodes and 4732 edges.

## Visualization

   The chapter includes visualizations that provide insights into:

   - Node Degree Distribution: Displays the number of nodes with specific degrees.

   - Accuracy by Node Degree: Highlights how well the GAT model performs based on the nodeâ€™s degree.

## Conclusion

   Chapter 7 offers a hands-on experience with GATs, combining theory with practical examples.
   By running the provided code, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how attention mechanisms enhance graph neural networks, especially in citation network datasets like Cora and CiteSeer.
