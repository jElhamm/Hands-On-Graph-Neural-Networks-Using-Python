# Chapter 4

   In this chapter, we dive deep into graph processing and recommendation systems, using powerful techniques like Node2Vec and applying them to practical use cases such as movie recommendations.

## Key Concepts Covered:

   1. Graph Creation and Visualization:

      - Learn how to create graphs using the Erdos-Renyi model and visualize them with intuitive plotting techniques.

   2. Random Walks and Node2Vec:

      - Understand random walks on graphs and generate meaningful node sequences.

      - Apply the Node2Vec algorithm to create node embeddings.

      - Train a Word2Vec model on these walks and evaluate its quality using machine learning models such as Random Forest.

   3. MovieLens Data Processing:

      - Download and preprocess the MovieLens dataset.

      - Build a movie co-occurrence graph based on user ratings.

      - Use Node2Vec embeddings to recommend movies based on their similarity.

## Files Included:

   - [chapter4.py](Chapter04/chapter4.py): A Python script version of the code for this chapter, structured for those who prefer running the script directly.

   - [chapter4.ipynb](Chapter04/chapter4.ipynb): A Jupyter Notebook version for interactive exploration and visualization of the concepts.

## Install

   Ensure you have the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
   !pip install -q node2vec==0.4.6
   !pip install -qI gensim==4.3.0
```
