# Chapter 3

   This chapter dives deep into the intersections of [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and network analysis, covering key concepts such as:

   - Text preprocessing and skipgram generation.

   - Word embedding using Word2Vec models.

   - Random walks on graphs and their applications.

   - Node classification in the Karate Club graph.

   - Visualization of node embeddings using t-SNE.

## Files

   This chapter includes two files:

   - [`chapter3.py`](Chapter03/chapter3.py) (Python script)

   - [`chapter3.ipynb`](Chapter03/chapter3.ipynb) (Jupyter Notebook)

   Both files implement the same code but in different formats. You can run either depending on your preference.

## Key Components of the Code:

   **1. Text Processing**: We demonstrate how to process text into skipgrams, which are then used for Word2Vec embedding generation.

   **2. Word Embedding Model**: Using Word2Vec, the model generates embeddings for the text and for random walks on the graph.

   **3. Graph Visualizations**: We create and visualize both an Erdos-Renyi graph and the famous Karate Club graph, showcasing network structures and community divisions.

   **4. Random Walks**: We simulate random walks on the graph, which are then used to generate node embeddings.

   **5. t-SNE Visualization**: Node embeddings are visualized using t-SNE to project high-dimensional vectors into a 2D space.

   **6. Node Classification**: A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the node embeddings to classify the nodes of the Karate Club graph.

## Results:

   By the end of the chapter, you'll have learned how to:

   - Generate skipgrams from text.

   - Train a Word2Vec model on both text and graph-based random walks.

   - Visualize network structures and node embeddings.

   - Classify nodes in a graph with high accuracy using a machine learning model.
